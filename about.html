            <h2>About</h2>
            &nbsp;
            <p>The banded butterflyfish (Chaetodon striatus) is a kind of marine ray-finned fish that may be found in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean from Brazil to Bermuda. Common names for this fish include banded butterflyfish, butterbun, butterflyfish, Portuguese butterfly, school mistress, and banded mariposa.<br>

                The name is derived from the body of the fish's black vertical bars. This, along with a vertical, black bar through the eye, is an antipredator adaption, as the bands obstruct the body's contours.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            &nbsp;

            <p>The banded butterflyfish may become as long as 16 cm (6.3 in) at its largest size. <br>
            <br>The dorsal fin includes between 19 and 21 soft rays and 12 spines. The anal fin comprises 16 to 17 soft rays and 3 spines.
            <br> This fish has a silvery tint with a narrow black bar running across its eye, two wide black bars running through the middle of the body, and a third wide bar running from the back of the dorsal fin to the caudal peduncle.
            <br>The caudal fin is black, as are the pelvic fins.</p>

                Distribution And Habitat
            </h2>
            &nbsp;
            <p>This fish is indigenous to the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic Ocean, often at depths of 20 to 55 metres (66 to 180 feet).<br>
            The Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Bermuda, and the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago are all included in its range, which stretches from Massachusetts in the United States to Santa Catarina in Brazil. On coral reefs, it can be found as a benthic fish.

            </h2>
            <p>The banded butterflyfish is often encountered alone or in couples, although it may sometimes be seen in tiny shoals of 20 or fewer fish.
            <br>Small invertebrates, crustaceans, coral polyps, polychaete worms, tube worms, sea anemones[4] and different eggs make up the majority of the diet. In groups of up to 20, it also feeds on plankton in the water column.
            <br> It occasionally performs the function of a cleaning fish by clearing off the exterior parasites on surgeon fish, grunts, and parrot fish.
